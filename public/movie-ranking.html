<h1>The Best Movies </h1>
<h2>(That I can think of right now)</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Muppets Cristmas Carol</h3>
<p>A clasic. A musical with Micheal Cain playing Scrooge straight while everyone else has a grand old time.<br />
What more could you possibly want?</p>
<h3>From Up on Poppy Hill</h3>
<p>A movie in which nothing happens and it is magical. True slice of life goodness.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Prison escape movie where the bad guy gets exactly what he deserves.</p>
